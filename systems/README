Each system recovered had different contents and hasn't been consolidated into a master (yet).
As the drives public contents are recovered, these file trees will be added/annotated.

Then selected superset of these will become a master for the systems as a whole.

Many different systems (VMC, 375, LMC, GVC, ...) were ported/developed, including unique ones,

Most of the remaining system units had a single ST506 drive, thus the st506 directory of each of
these corresponds to the public contents (there are other contents as well) of each drive.

Additional files amount to other details of such units as desired.
